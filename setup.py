The lead part of the alchemist's toolkit.

Yes, it's Yet Another SQLAlchemy/Zope Integration Package. I'm sorry,
I really am. Many thanks to Andreas Jung for z3c.sqlalchemy and Kapil 
Thangavelu for ore.alchemist. I borrowed the Zope transaction data
manager code from Andreas who borrowed it from Kapil, I believe.

The purpose of this package is to be the lead part and the lead part only.
The gold-making bit is left to SQLAlchemy. That means that are no 
abstractions or lazy initialisaion or table auto-detection for building 
SQLAlchemy table metadata and mappers, no generation of Zope 3 interfaces,
no CRUD operations, and no dancing polar bears.

You need to understand SQLAlchemy for this package and this README to make 
any sense. See http://sqlalchemy.org/doc.

NOTE: collective.lead 1.0 targets SQLAlchemy 0.3 only. Subsequent versions 
will target SQLAlchemy 0.4.

The use case
------------

 - You want SQLAlchemy
 
 - You want to look up database connections/sessions as named utilities
 
 - You want to use simple domain/mapper classes, with no particular 
   dependencies
   
 - You don't want to worry about transaction and connection handling
 
 - You want to be able to configure SQL connection parameters at run-time,
   e.g. in the ZODB. Well, you don't have to, but it's nice to have the
   option.
